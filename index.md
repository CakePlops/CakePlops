## Welcome to Cake Plops!

My name's Felicia, and I have been baking cake pops since 2012. I've made pops for birthday parties, bridal showers, and community service events as a friend and family member, and now I'm bringing my foods to the public. You can find me at the Wenonah Farmer's Market on select Thursdays from 4-7PM throughout the summer and fall!

### So, what's a cake pop?

It's pretty simple, and pretty delicious.

Imagine freshly baked cake, deliberately crumbled into teeny tiny pieces, rolled and combined with delicious frosting, crafted into a spherical shape (SPHERICAL!), then carefully dipped in smooth, molten chocolate.
